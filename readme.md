![hero](img/hero.png)

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Azure DevOps to automate common tasks like building, testing, and deploying your code. You will learn how to create a pipeline using YML and Bicep, and how to use triggers, variables, and templates to make your pipeline more flexible and reusable. You will also learn how to deploy your code to multiple environments and how to create a library of reusable templates.

We'll start from scratch and build up to a full CI/CD YML pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys a simple web application to Azure. By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Azure DevOps to automate your development process and how to create a reusable pipeline components that can be easily adapted to different projects and environments.
